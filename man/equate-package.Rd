\title{Observed-Score Linking and Equating}
\description{
Contains methods for observed-score linking and equating under the
single-group, equivalent-groups, and nonequivalent-groups with anchor
test(s) designs. Equating types include identity, mean, linear, general
linear, equipercentile, circle-arc, and composites of these. Equating
methods include synthetic, nominal weights, Tucker, Levine observed score,
Levine true score, Braun/Holland, frequency estimation, and chained
equating. Plotting and summary methods, and methods for multivariate
presmoothing and bootstrap error estimation are also provided.
